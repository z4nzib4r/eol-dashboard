# EOL Dashboard

A simple React dashboard for tracking software patches and EOL dates. It is a front end that runs on data from a local JSON file and the [endoflife.date](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date) API.

## Run locally

Clone the repo and `cd` into directory.

Use Node 16.18.1 and run `npm install`.

Open the file `/src/assets/json/product-list.json` and add software projects and version details from [endoflife.date](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date).
 
Run 'npm start' to view the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`.

Patch your software!
