# EOL Dashboard

A simple React dashboard for tracking software patches and EOL dates. It is just a front end that runs on data from a local JSON file and the [endoflife.date](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date) API.

## Not for Production
Don't deploy this to a public URL without password protection!

## Run locally

Clone the repo.
Use Node 16.18.1 and run `npm install` in the eol-dashboard directory. 
Then run 'npm start' to view the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`.
